## re_lib

### re_lib - Readable library

Readable, small and portable C and C++ library.

All libraries should be easy to read, to understand, and to customize.

I'm trying to make single-file libraries only for convenience.


### Description

Should be easy to read, to use, to compile, to modify. Most of libraries can be used independently.

| name | c/cpp | version | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| [rjson.h](/rjson.h) | c99+ | 0.1 | Zero allocation json reader |
